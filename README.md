Hello, World! I'm a high school student with a passion for Minecraft Mod Development, which I do through a mod repository known as CurseForge. I am also a self-taught programmer and can program at a basic level in C# and Java. I've expanded my depths into video production and editing, and occasionally upload videos on my YouTube channel on topics ranging from software/client installation tutorials to mod showcases, which you can check out below.

I also have an immense passion for video games and helped Co-Found an online gaming organization back in 2020 with a few online friends, which currently has over 30 members across North America and Europe. We have established an organized e-sports team for Minecraft, Valorant, and other video games, and have won hundreds of dollars in prize money through competing and winning various tournaments. üèÜ
